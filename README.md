In May 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52633355) search interest in online casinos had hit an all-time high in the UK since lockdown began, according to data.

Google Trends showed gambling had moved online amid the closure of physical gambling venues and cancellation of sports events.

Problem gamblers told the BBC lockdown measures were a "recipe for disaster".

Watchdog the Gambling Commission said there had been a rise in some online gambling, but there was no evidence yet of a rise in problem gambling.
